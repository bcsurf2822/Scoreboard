## Basketball Scoreboard Project - Review

### Summary

For this project, I recreated a basketball scoreboard using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I was provided with a Figma slide, and my goal was to replicate the design as closely as possible from scratch.

### Challenges

The most challenging part of this mini-project was getting the CSS just right to match the Figma design.

### Features

In addition to replicating the design, I added a new feature that allows the user to reset the score for each team to 0, providing a "New Game" function.
